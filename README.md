# huffmanCoding

The project is centered around implementing Huffman Coding, a lossless data compression algorithm. The process involves assigning variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies to ensure a prefix-free and unambiguous code system. The implementation will utilize a priority queue and a binary tree to create a file compression and uncompression system.

Key steps include reading a file to count byte frequencies, constructing the Huffman coding tree, generating a byte encoding table, compressing the file, and finally decompressing it to match the original file.

## How to use
Upon launching the application, you will be greeted with the Welcome Screen. Here you can choose to

- **Compress**

    Selecting Upload data from text file will open a file dialog where you can choose a text file from your computer that contains the data in this format

- **Uncompress** 

    You'll be prompted to input the number of power sources and then assign an LED to each power source.
